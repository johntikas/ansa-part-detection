# Introduction
ANSA is an advanced pre-processing software tool used in computer aided engineering problems, manufactured by BETA CAE Systems. Its widespread use among the industry could be attributed to the inexhaustible functionality options it lends to its users, allowing them to introduce precise and efficient modifications in CAD models and eventually produce ready-to-run solver input files. For the most part, its userbase is comprised of mechanical engineers working in the automotive sector, predominanlty using TOPO and MESH for editing geometry and mesh respectively, along with more tools to facilitate industry-specific experiments such as crash tests. Although data mangement has been a fundamental objective for over a decade across its development timeline, a feature supporting part detection within the 3D models has yet to be implemented.

# Motivation
Identifying structures with similar geomtries in 3D CAD models is crucial for assigning them identical properties, meshing parameters, material attributes and connection types. This in turn, facilitates the preparation for the solution part as all of these objects are expected to exhibit similar behaviours under various experimental conditions. A CAE engineer would typically dissect those elements manually by using the toolbar. Nonetheless, there are occasions where ANSA databases may include thousands of geometry elements and part libraries come with several dozens of different items to distinguish. Hence, autoamtic the time-consuming part detection process becomes a necessity.

# Requirements
