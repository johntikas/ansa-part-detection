# ANSA Part Detection
ANSA is an advanced pre-processing software tool used in computer aided engineering problems, manufactured by BETA CAE Systems. Its widespread use among the industry could be attributed to the inexhaustible functionality options it lends to its users, allowing them to introduce precise and efficient modifications in CAD models and eventually produce ready-to-run solver input files. For the most part, its userbase is comprised of mechanical engineers working in the automotive sector, predominanlty using TOPO and MESH for editing geometry and mesh respectively, along with more tools to facilitate industry-specific experiments such as crash tests. Although data mangement has been a fundamental objective for over a decade across its development timeline, a feature supporting part detection within the 3D models has yet to be implemented.
